# Spring MVC Film CRUD
## Made by Maggie and Sawyer


# Overview
Hello and Welcome to our MVC Film Query Web Application! Here you can find data on movies stored in our database by either, entering in that movies film ID, or a relevant keyword that is contained within the title or description of the film.

Once you have submitted your search, you will come to a page of results. If you chose to search by ID it will immediately print a page with details about the film pertaining to the entered ID. If you chose to search by a keyword, it will print a list of films that match the entered keyword. Each film that was presented, functions as a hyperlink to the film details page for that film.

You may choose to either delete or update the film you have selected, or even add a new film.

# Lessons Learned

- Using a controller to map several methods using a DAO, the biggest obstacle we faced was updating films and actors due to needing seperate methods to have the model access different files. 

- Became much more familiar and comfortable with JSP syntax, specifically towards c: functions.

- Being very thorough with mapping and using field names that are not ambiguous.
